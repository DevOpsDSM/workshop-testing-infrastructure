# Testing Server Configuration

One type of infrastructure testing is config management tests. Config management
systems are great at configuring users, application, services and files and if we
use them, we would like to be able to test that they did their jobs.

There are a handful of tools to test config management systems:

 - [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) - ruby
 - [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) - ruby
 - [Testinfra](http://testinfra.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - python


## Workshop Exercises

We will be writing testing that an Ubuntu server has a service running, a package installed,
and a file with certain contents and permissions.

To show off different testing libraries, we will implement the tests using the different frameworks
below:

### Server Spec (Ruby)

### Test Kitchen (Ruby)

### Testinfra (Python)
